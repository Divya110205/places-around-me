Ulagalandha Perumal Temple is a temple dedicated to Vishnu located in Kanchipuram, Tamil Nadu, India. Constructed in 
the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is glorified in the Naalayira Divya Prabandham, the early medieval 
Tamil canon of the Alvar saints from the 6th through 9th centuries CE. It is one of the 108 Divya Desams dedicated 
to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Ulagalantha Perumal, and his consort Lakshmi as Amuthavalli. The temple is believed 
to have been built by the Pallavas, with later contributions from the medieval Cholas, Vijayanagara kings, and 
Madurai Nayaks.
