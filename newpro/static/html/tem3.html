The temple of Kachabeswarar has a wide array of sculptures and stone carved idols. The stone mandapam with 27 
exquisitely carved pillars, the beautifully constructed stone pillars of the Maha mandapam, sculpted 
gopurams are all examples of the architectural beauty of the shrine. The main deity Sri Kachabeswarar is in 
the form of Shiva Lingam, which is said to be 'Swayambhu'. Goddess Anjanakshi Ambaal faces south, her idol 
tall and beautiful with wonderful grace on her face. Many smaller shrines of Ganesha, Karthikeya, Saraswathi, 
Bhairava etc are on the outer parikarma path. There is also a beautiful pond for this temple called 'Koorma 
Theertham'.
