Thiru Parameswara Vinnagaram or Vaikunta Perumal Temple is a temple dedicated to Vishnu, located in Kanchipuram 
in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is 
glorified in the Nalayira Divya Prabandham, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Alvar saints from the 6th 
through the 9th centuries CE. It is one among the 108 Divya Desams dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as 
Vaikuntanathan and his consort Lakshmi as Sri Vaikundavalli. The temple is considered the second oldest extant 
temple in Kanchipuram after the Kailasanthar temple.
